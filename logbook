made and ran the Locustag.py to isolate the genes provided by the Riboswitches Lucas.csv from the sequence.txt downloaded from NCBI.
by ([A-Z]+)\n --> \1 followed by (\>) --> \n\1 deletd all the line feeds and made one line seqs.

reformated the .csv file to look like a fasta file
(\d+)\t([\-\+])\t(\d+)\t(\d+)\t(\w+).+\t([A-Z].+) --> >\5|\2|\1-\3|\4\n\6
this makes it easier to combine the files.
combined the fasta files and cleaned it up

going to change the splitting.py


TODO:
make py script so new folders are created for every set instead of all files in one folder creating a chaos of files.
